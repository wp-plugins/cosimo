Users of [NextGEN gallery](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) can prepare a gallery of wallpapers and use them on Cosimo settings.
A string in the glob-style format, for example, &#42;69&#42;Summer, Spring?-Break&#42;, etc. can also select images from the media library.
The change interval may following a number of page views or time (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years done).
The background image is used on the site about inline CSS, as in this example:
>body {background-image:url(http://...../wp-content/uploads/bg-superduper.jpg) !important;}
